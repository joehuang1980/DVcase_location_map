## Quick Start

1. **Read GEMINI.md first** - Contains essential rules for the Gemini CLI
2. Follow the pre-task compliance checklist before starting any work
3. Use proper module structure under `src/main/[language]/`
4. Commit after every completed task

## Universal Flexible Project Structure

Choose the structure that fits your project:

**Simple Projects:** Basic src/, tests/, docs/, output/ structure
**Standard Projects:** Full application structure with modular organization  
**AI/ML Projects:** Complete MLOps-ready structure with data, models, experiments

## Development Guidelines

- **Always search first** before creating new files
- **Extend existing** functionality rather than duplicating  
- **Break down complex tasks**
- **Single source of truth** for all functionality
- **Language-agnostic structure** - works with Python, JS, Java, etc.
- **Scalable** - start simple, grow as needed
- **Flexible** - choose complexity level based on project needs
